#EAGLE#

![ScreenShot](/logo.png)

Search for **relative absent words (RAW)** in genomic sequences using a reference sequence.
Currently, eagle runs on command line linux environment, building an image with patterns reporting the absent words regions as well as reporting the associated positions into a file.

## INSTALLATION ##

Simply run the following instructions at a Linux terminal:

<pre>
wget https://github.com/pratas/eagle/archive/master.zip
unzip master.zip
cd eagle-master
make cleanall 
make
</pre>

Note that these instructions will install EAGLE and several minimal programs to 
cope with specific needs, such as 3D visualization on Gnuplot.

## EXECUTION

### Run EAGLE

Run eagle using:

<pre>
./eagle -v -c 11 -i -r HG -t SEQ
</pre>

for search RAWs with size 11 that are absent from the human genome and present in
a specific genomic sequence (SEQ).

### Run EAGLE on 99 Ebola virus using human as reference

For a current outbreak example run:

<pre>
. RunAll.sh
</pre>

It will download, filter and find RAWs with an output 3D plot.
Nevertheless, make sure that you have gnuplot installed on your Linux box. 
If not use:

<pre>
sudo apt-get install gnuplot
</pre>

to install.
The output will be a 3D interactive plot, such as the following example:
