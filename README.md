Search for **relative absent words (RAW)** in genomic sequences using a reference sequence. Currently, EAGLE runs on command line linux environment. It reports into files the absent words, in a k-mer range size, as well as the associated positions. EAGLE ca run in a multi-threading mode to minimize computation times. Currently is limited to Linux and OSX (\*nix)

## INSTALLATION ##

Simply run the following instructions at a Linux terminal:

<pre>
wget https://github.com/pratas/eagle/archive/master.zip
unzip master.zip
cd eagle-master
make cleanall 
make
</pre>

Note that these instructions will install EAGLE and several minimal programs to 
cope with specific needs, such as 3D visualization on Gnuplot.

## EXECUTION

### Run EAGLE

Run EAGLE using:

<pre>
./EAGLE -v -min 11 -max 14 -i -r SEQ1 SEQ2
</pre>

for search RAWs with size 11 to 14 that are absent from SEQ1 and present in a specific genomic sequence (SEQ2).

### Run EAGLE on 157 Ebola virus using human as reference

For a current outbreak example, simply run (it already includes the installation process):

<pre>
wget https://github.com/pratas/eagle/blob/master/RunAll.sh
. RunAll.sh
</pre>

It will install, download, filter and find RAWs, outputing a 3D plot.
Nevertheless, make sure that you have gnuplot installed on your Linux box. 
If not use:

<pre>
sudo apt-get install gnuplot
</pre>

to install.
The output will be a 3D interactive plot, such as the following example:

Usage: EAGLE &#60OPTIONS&#62 ... -r [FILE]  [FILE]:&#60...&#62

  -a                       about EAGLE,            
  -t                       use multi-threading,            
  -i                       use inversions,

  -max &#60k-mer&#62             k-mer maximum size,              
                                                    
  -r  [rFile]              reference file (database),

### Options meaning

| Parameters          | Meaning                                                     |
|---------------------|:------------------------------------------------------------|
| -h                  | It will print the parameters menu (help menu)                                        |
| -v                  | It will print progress information such as number of MAWs, etc.    |
| -a                  | It will print the EAGLE version number, license type and authors.                    |
| -t                  | It will use multiple-threading. The number of threads will be equal to the maximum k-mer less the minimum k-mer. The time to accomplish the task will be much lower, although it will use more memory (memory from each model is cumulative).                   |
| -i                  | Inverted words (reverse complemented) will also be considered. |
| -min &#60;k-mer&#62;   | Size of the minimum k-mer (word size). Possible interval [1;28]. Contexts above 16 will be handled with a hash-table, where the implementation is approximately linear in memory relatively to the size of the sequence. |
| -max &#60;k-mer&#62;   | Size of the maximum k-mer (word size). Possible interval [1;28]. Contexts above 16 will be handled with a hash-table, where the implementation is approximately linear in memory relatively to the size of the sequence. |
| -r [refFile]        | The reference filename. Accepted sequence alphabet [A,C,G,T,N]. |
| [tarFile]           | The target filename(s). For multiple file usage separate by ":". Example: Virus1:Virus2:virus3. Accepted sequence alphabet [A,C,G,T,N]. |
